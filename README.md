This assignment aims to familiarize us with the use of a version control system like git, which is essential for managing collaborative work. A version control system helps monitor modifications to our files, essentially creating varied versions of them. It empowers us to determine the changes to be incorporated into the subsequent version, and each of these changes is cataloged as a commit, along with pertinent metadata. The focus of this assignment is primarily on crafting commit messages. Properly composed commit messages are key to managing and maintaining any collaborative project, or even for our future self to comprehend changes made. Therefore, it's crucial to use clear, concise language when writing commit messages.
